Applications used:
- Waybar
- Picom
- Swww
- Zsh
- Hyprland - modified hyprdots config (for rofi mainly)
- Arch Linux
- Neovim - theme oxonvim,
- LunarVim
- Kitty
- Zsh (I do not update the bashrc anymore)
  
All the files are symlinked copies of the actual config files.
If the configuration of your system matches mine you can simply clone the repo and copy the files over to your home directory.
Config files for both zsh and bash have been included, however, they are slightly different, I cannot guarantee whether the bashrc will 
work for all the scenarios however, the zshrc will

```
git clone https://github.com/viraj-s15/.dotfiles.git
```

After the repo has been cloned you can copy the files with
whatever way you prefer.
