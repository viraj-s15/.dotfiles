Finally created a symlinked version of the dotfiles.
Contains all the config files for my arch rice.

Applications used:
- Waybar
- Picom
- Swww
- Zsh
- Hyprland
- Arch Linux
- Neovim
- Kitty
  
All the files are symlinked copies of the actual config files.
If the configuration of your system matches mine you can simply clone the repo and copy the files over to your home directory.
For bash you will not face any issues however, for zsh the given config file will not work.

```
git clone https://github.com/viraj-s15/.dotfiles.git
```

After the repo has been cloned you can copy the files with
whatever way you prefer.
